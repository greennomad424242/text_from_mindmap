      " Tableau, PowerBI and other tools are great for some data visualization, but I wanted to use some newer tools to better visualize multi-dimensional data.\n",
      " Using some Javascript libraries, I built a quick tool to parse and view \"many-to-many\" datasets and show them in three dimensions. (Many-to-many datasets might include: transactions between countries, social networks, or website traffic.)\n",
      " <div style=\"text-align: left\"><span>The \"creator\" version of this tool is used to parse and filter raw datasets. It isn't ready for public release, but I wanted to show some data in the \"viewer\" version.</span></div>\n",
      " You can see that this view represents a lot of complex data in its entirety. This isn't meant to be something that I drop into an executive's Powerpoint and walk away.  This is more of a working tool that I can use to use to explore the data. Any insights I discover would be distilled into more accessible line charts or other visualizations.<br>\n",
      " Be sure to click around the viz and zoom around.\n",
      " You can click the \"rotation\" button and see the structure rotate. if you've moused around already, you might want to hit reload before using the rotation functionality.\n",
      " <div style=\"text-align: left\"><span>This is an alpha version that is cheaply hosted on GitHub pages.</span></div>\n",
      " This was made with <a href=\"https://github.com/vasturiano/3d-force-graph\">3d-force-graph</a> and <a href=\"https://gmousse.gitbooks.io/dataframe-js/content/doc/api/dataframe.html\">Dataframe.js</a>\n",
      " <div style=\"text-align: left\"><span>When hosted in a standalone website, this visualization can be embedded in Tableau or other tool. This would help tell the story more comprehensively.</span></div>\n",
      " Since this is built with Javascript, there are dozens of other frameworks that can probably show a similar view.\n",
      " There is also great tooling available in Python.\n",
      " I'll continue to evolve this tool and other projects. Feel free to hit me up on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthowes/\">LinkedIn</a>.\n",
