 Tableau, PowerBI and other tools are great for some data visualization, but I wanted to use some newer tools to better visualize multi-dimensional data. Using some Javascript libraries, I built a quick tool to parse and view "many-to-many" datasets and show them in three dimensions. (Many-to-many datasets might include: transactions between countries, social networks, or website traffic.) The "creator" version of this tool is used to parse and filter raw datasets. It isn't ready for public release, but I wanted to show some data in the "viewer" version. You can see that this view represents a lot of complex data in its entirety. This isn't meant to be something that I drop into an executive's Powerpoint and walk away.  This is more of a working tool that I can use to use to explore the data. Any insights I discover would be distilled into more accessible line charts or other visualizations.<br> Be sure to click around the viz and zoom around. You can click the "rotation" button and see the structure rotate. if you've moused around already, you might want to hit reload before using the rotation functionality. This is an alpha version that is cheaply hosted on GitHub pages. This was made with <a href="https://github.com/vasturiano/3d-force-graph">3d-force-graph</a> and <a href="https://gmousse.gitbooks.io/dataframe-js/content/doc/api/dataframe.html">Dataframe.js</a> When hosted in a standalone website, this visualization can be embedded in Tableau or other tool. This would help tell the story more comprehensively. Since this is built with Javascript, there are dozens of other frameworks that can probably show a similar view. There is also great tooling available in Python. I'll continue to evolve this tool and other projects.
